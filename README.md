# Asstroids 💥🍑

Asstroids is a Pygame-based arcade game inspired by the classic **Asteroids**,  
except here you’re not blasting space rocks — you’re splitting *booty.png* into smaller pieces until nothing is left!

## 🎯 Game Objective
Pilot your ship, aim your gun, and shoot down incoming booty.  
When hit, booty splits into smaller chunks until they disappear.  
Survive as long as you can without getting hit yourself!
